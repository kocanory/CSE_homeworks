It's been said money talks If so what does it say?
Four simple words we see every day
The rich, the poor Heaven is for those who choose
Don't put your trust in money You'll lose (again and again)
In God we trust In Him we must believe (He is the only way)
In God we trust His Son we must receive (Tomorrow's too late, accept Him today)
